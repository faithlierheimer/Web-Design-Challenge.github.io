            <h5>The community impact area evaluates the company's positive impact on the external communities in which the company operates.
            The scatter plot below maps the community impact area scores of all US B Corps in our dataset vs 
            their overall impact scores shows that variation in overall impact scores can be explained about 
            38% of the time by variation in community impact scores. Click graph to enlarge.</h5>

            <h5> The customers impact area evaluates the company's value to their direct customers and consumers 
                of their products and services, and asks questions like whether the company specifically benefits 
                underserved populations, addresses social and/or economic problems, or helps create access to basic 
                services. The below scatterplot mapping the customers impact area score vs. the overall impact score 
                shows that variation in overall impact score can be explained by variation in the customers impact score

            <h5>The environment impact area measures overall environmental stewardship of the company. 
                This impact area asks questions such as how the company identifies and manages general 
                environmental impacts, specifically with air and climate issues, water sustainability, and 
                impacts on land and life. The scatterplot below maps the environment impact score vs the

            <h5>The governance impact area evaluates the overall mission ethics, accountability, and transparency

            <h5>The Workers Impact Area evaluates a companyâ€™s contribution to financial, physical, professional, and social 
                well-being, and asks questions primarily centered around whether most employees are full time, part time, or 
                temporary, and whether their compensation is fixed, hourly, or daily, and weather the company is committed to 
                hiring underemployed populations. A scatterplot mapping the workers impact area score vs. the overall impact 
                shows a loose linear relationship between the two areas, and that variation in the overall impact score can be
                explained by variation in the workers impact score about 19% of the time. Click graph to enlarge.
