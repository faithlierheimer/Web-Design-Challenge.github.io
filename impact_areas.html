            The scatter plot below maps the community impact area scores of all US B Corps in our dataset vs 
            their overall impact scores shows that variation in overall impact scores can be explained about 
            38% of the time by variation in community impact scores.</h5>

            <h5> The customers impact area evaluates the company's value to their direct customers and consumers 
                of their products and services, and asks questions like whether the company specifically benefits 
                underserved populations, addresses social and/or economic problems, or helps create access to basic 
                services. The below scatterplot mapping the customers impact area score vs. the overall impact score 
                shows that variation in overall impact score can be explained by variation in the customers impact score 
                about 0.8% of the time.

                environmental impacts, specifically with air and climate issues, water sustainability, and 
                impacts on land and life. The scatterplot below maps the environment impact score vs the 
                overall impact score and shows that variation in overall impact scores can be explained about 
                15% of the time by variation in environment impact sores.</h5>
